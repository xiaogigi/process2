    <p>Seattle's Street fo Dreams is now a street fo nightmares. The collection of multimillion dollar luxury homes was recently burned to ghe ground by people claming to be eco-terrorists. Eco-terror, according to the FBI, is defined as the use of violence against victims or property by an environmentally oriented group of environmental-political reasons. The FBI considers environmental terrorism to be the NO.1 domestic terror threat facing the US.<br>Some experts think the rising of eco-terrorists is resulted by the frequent eco-awarness campaign. They explained that with the increasing awarness of climate change, the threat of global warming is getting more and more overstated, and the public should face this issue more calmly and objectively.
