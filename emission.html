    <p>Recently, a new slogan "Killed by Global Warming or Net Zero Emissions" sweep the social media. The origin of the slogan has to go back to 2019, when the UN decided to enforce Net Zero Emission Programme in order to keep global temperature from rising another 2 degree celsius. All the energy plants are required to use Clean Energy Systems. Due to the high cost of oxy-fuel combustion technology, energy plants can only produce a very limited amount of energy. And government is responsible for allocating this limited amount of energy to each neightborhood to maintain basic life activities. Nowadays, we can see all kinds of dgital entertainment devices are abandoned in front of houses, due to the shortage of electric energy. The world's economy is experiencing a radical transformation. An unknown era is waiting in front of us.</p>
