    <p>Recently, Borneo National Prak has been opened to the public in Borneo, Indonesia. It marks a big conservation win for Indonesian goverment. In the past 20 years, Indonesian government and environmental authorities have been putting decades of efforts into increasing production, better use of land, and greater engagement with the people who live on the land. As a result, it's getting easier for companies get consessions for degraded lands. Communities have become stakeholders in expanding production and they are also beneficiaries of the production process. Degraded and non-forest land has become the first choice of palm oil production in Indonesia.</p>
