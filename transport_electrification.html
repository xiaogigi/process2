    <h1>Shenzhen 100% Transport Electrification</h1>
    </div>  
    <div id="news_content">
    <p>In 16 years, Shenzhen has became the first city to electrify 100% of its public transport. Back to 2018, Shenzhen had already succeeded to replace all their public buses with electric buses. Following this green transit revolution, Shenzhen moved on to make all its taxis go electric, and their success of this action becomes an inspiration for the rest of world. Experts say:" The kind of sweeping changes that Shenzhen pulled off won't come to US cities without full national support and buy-in from local transit agencies."</p>
